这是一本关于波普艺术家**[安迪·沃霍尔](https://www.warhol.org/)**的传记，这个曾经创造了无数经典形象的男人--毛泽东、玛丽莲梦露、可口可乐....每个人都有自己的生活哲学，不可能看到某本“哲学”书籍就全盘拿来主义。但是，安迪确实是挺有意思的一个人，书中比较特别的一些观点值得记录一下。

<!-- more -->

以序言中的一句话开始：

> 事实上，学会想事情的方法比弄清楚一个事情的概念，不知道要重要多少。



译者序里，Lou Reed在*Drella‘s song*的*Work*中唱到：

>Sometimes I can't decide what I should do
>
>I think what would Andy have said
>
>He'd probably say you think too much
>
>That's cause there's work that you don't want to do
>
>It's work, the most important thing is work
>
>Work, the most important thing is work



## B和我

第一章 是他和他的朋友B(Brigid Berlin)的对话，每天早上他都会和B通话。

> People are always calling me  a mirror, and if a mirror looks into a mirror, what is there to see?
>
> \- 当我看着镜子，我只知道我看到的自己跟别人看到的不同。
>
> \- 因为我看待自己的方式，是我想看到的自己。我只为我自己做那些表情。我不会去做那些别人看得到我做的表情。我不会扭着嘴唇说：“钱呢？”

安迪这么形容在镜子中的自己：

> 那无动于衷的凝视，那流溢散发的优雅......
>
> 那百无聊赖的疲倦，那衰弱乏力的苍白......
>
> 那时髦别致的古怪，那听天由命的惊异，那隐秘诱人的知识......
>
> 那廉价庸俗的欢乐，那渴望启示的神情，那粉白淘气的面具，那有点斯拉夫人的长相......
>
> 那孩子般的、嚼着口香糖式的天真，那根源于绝望的魅力，那孤芳自赏的漫不经心，那彻头彻尾的另类，那纤弱飘忽，那朦胧的、窥探式的、暧昧的不详光晕，那孱弱、谈吐温文的奇妙风度，那皮与骨......
>
> 那...粉白皮肤，那...膝盖，那...双唇

这段原文：

> The affectless gaze, the **diffracted** grace...
>
> The bored **languor**, the wasted **pallor**...
>
> The chick freakiness, the basically passive astonishment, the **enthralling** secret knowledge...
>
> The **chintzy** joy, the **revelatory** **tropisms**, the **chalky**, **puckish** mask, the slightly Slavic look...
>
> The childlike gum-chewing **naivete**, the glamour rooted in despair, the self-admiring carelessness, the perfected otherness, the **wispiness**, the shadowy, **voyeuristic**, vaguely **sinister** aura, the pale, soft spoken magical presence, the skin and bones...



关于uniforms，他说：

> 人最好永远穿着同一套衣服，这样就能知道大家喜欢你是因为真正的你，而不是衣着所造就的那个你。
>
> Anyway, it's more exciting to see where people live than what they wear.

他也喜欢牛仔裤，

> I wish I could invent something like bluejeans. Something to be remembered for. Something mass.
>
> I want to die with my bluejeans on.



他小时候得过好几次*风湿性舞蹈症*，有点像多动症。

> 一个人不化妆的时候，看起来最让人想亲吻。玛丽莲的双唇不属于令人想亲吻的唇，却非常适合拍照。



安迪开始租房时甚至找不到一个可以谈心的室友（他们只是觉得找到了一个可以分摊房租的人），但是后来他和很多人一起合租过了，这些人反而开始追着他开始诉说了。

> As soon as you stop wanting something you get it. I've found that to be absolutely axiomatic.
>
> 一旦你不再想要某个东西，你就会得到它。



## 爱-衰老期（Senility）

> The most exciting thing is ***not-doing-it***. 
>
> If you fall in love with someone and never do it, it's much more exciting.



下面这句说的很真实，或许有点过于现实了

> Love affairs get too involved, and they're not really worth it. But if, for some reason, you feel that they are, you should put in exactly as much time and energy as the other person. In other words, ***"I'll pay you if you pay me"***.

> Fantasty love is much better than reality love. Never doing it is very exciting. 
>
> The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.

到底什么才是爱情的样子：是双方精确计算的对等付出？还是真爱一方不计代价的给予？或许真正爱了才知道...安迪的话也不错，从一个非常聪明也非常worldly的人口中说出



关于长久的亲密关系，他说

> I wonder if it's possible to have a love affair that lasts forever. If you're married for thirty years and you're "cooking breakfast for the one you love" and he walks in, does his heart really skip a beat? I mean just a regular morning. I guess it skips a beat over that breakfast and that's nice, too. It's nice to have a little breakfast made for you.



关于Couples

> Couples do become like each other when they're toghther for a long time, because you like the person and you pick up their mannerisms and their little good habits. And you eat the same food.

好像是的，两个人在一起久了就是会有这种“夫妻相”，身体或精神上都会有。



这段描述真的很有意思：

> I get very nervous when I think someone is falling in love with me. Every time I have a "romance" I'm so nervous I bring the whole office with me. That's usually about five or six people. They all come to pick me up and then we go to pick her up. Love me, love my office.
>
> 
>
> Everybody winds up kissing the wrong person good-night. One of my ways of thanking the office for coming with me to chapterone is to make myself available to chapterone with their dates. One or two of them like to take advantage of that service, because one or two of them are a little like me, they don't want anything to happen. When *I'm* there, they tell me, nothing happens. **I make nothing happen.** Wherever I go. I can tell when one of them is glad to see me walk in the door, because something is happening and they can't wait for me to make nothing happen. Especially when they're **stranded** in Italy, because you know how the Italians like to make something happen. I'm the obvious **antidote**.



Andy关于“爱”的说法：

> People should fall in love with their eyes closed. Just close your eyes. Don't look.

换句话说，当你不确定爱不爱一个人的时候，用心去判断，而不是眼睛。



关于美人（beauties），他这么说

> I really don't care that much about "Beauties". What I really like are Talkers. To me, good talkers are beautiful because good talk is what I love. The word itself shows why I like Talkers better than Beauties, why I tape more than I film. It's not "talkies". ***Talkers are doing something. Beauties are being something.*** Which isn't necessarily bad, it's just that I don't know what it is that they're being. It's more fun to be with people who are doing things.

可能也是因为他是脱口秀主持人的原因，他对Talkers更欣赏。



美与暴力

> Some people, even intelligent people, say that violence can be beautiful. I can't understand that, because beautiful is some moments, and for me those moments are never violent.

不同就是美（因为不同首先会被注意到）。

> Sometimes something can look beautiful just because it's different in some way from the other things around it. One red **petunia** in a window box will look very beautiful if all the rest of them are white, and vice versa.



## 名利（Fame)

> When you just see somebody in the street, they can really have an ***aura***. But then when they open their mouth, there goes the aura. "Aura" must be until you open your mouth.

每个人的“光环”，都在他开口后消失（或出现）。



这个解释了安迪想出名的原因（据说他是为了出名可以不顾一切）

> A good reason to be famous, though, is so you can read all the big magazines and know everybody in all the stories. Page after page it's just all people you've met. I love that kind of reading experience and that's the best reason to be famous.



关于TV Magic，或者说“上台不怯场”效应

> Certain people have TV magic: they fall completely apart off-camera but they are completely together on-camera. They shake and sweat before they go on, they shake and sweat during commercials, they shake and sweat when it's all over; but while the camera is filming them, they're **poised** and confident-looking. The camera turns them on and off.

他也说了他自己并不是那种拥有TV Magic的人

>I never fall apart because I never fall together. ... I can't think about anything that's going to come out of my mouth. "I'm going to faint".

这么看来安迪也不是那么神乎其神，普通人有的上台焦虑他也会有。想起了自己小时候每当到了台上（比如班里的讲台上）也会不由自主地发抖，是那种身体有轻微的发抖（可以控制的），但是语言能不能正常的说出来就由不得我了。开始以为*视力变差*会改善这个状况，因为这样就不用和台下乌压压的一片观众有眼神交流了；但是后来发现，视力真的变差了，然而自己会因为无法和台下的观众有眼神交流而变成一个arbitrary的演讲者，即不管自己讲的好坏（自认为还是好的），放飞自我了。这样产生的问题就是无法抓住观众的注意力，引导其进行思考，无法掌握一个更好的节奏感。



**WHAT YOU'RE WORTH**

> So you should always have a product that's not just "you". An actress should count up her plays and movies and a model should count up her photographs and a writer should count up his words and an artist should count up his pictures so you always know exactly what you're worth, and you don't get stuck thinking your product is you and your fame, and your aura.



## 工作（Work）

> An actress friend told me that after she didn't want money and jewels anymore, that's when she got money and jewels. I guess it's for our own good that it always happens that way, because after you stop wanting things is when having them won't make you go crazy.

当我们***非常***想要一个东西的时候（过程中），如果我们得到了它，那我们可能会疯掉（比如，突然中了五百万）；也即，如果我们能理智的想要一个东西，或者说得到那个东西我们有办法handle，那时候才是得到那个东西的最佳时机。



> Wherever it's possible, you should try to pay people in measurements that are the most suitable for their talent or job. A writer may want to get paid by the word, by the page, by the number of times the reader breaks down crying or bursts out laughing, by the chapter, by the number of new ideas introduced, by the book, or by the year, just to name a few possible categories. A director may want to get paid by the movie or by the foot or by the number of times a Chevrolet appears in the frames.

每个人做的事情（就工作而言）都可以用特定的尺度来衡量，确定其价值。



## 时间（Time）

> If the lines on your hands are wrinkles, it must mean your hands worry a lot. 

手就像脸一样，操心越多，皱纹越多



> They always say that time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.
>
> 他们总是说时间会改变一切，但事实上你得自己去改变它们。



**About Time**

`From time to time | Do time | Time yourself | weekends | In time | In no time | In good time | Between time | Time and again | Lifetime | Time-worn | Pass time | Mark time | Buy time | Keep time | On time | In time | Time off | Time out | Time in | Time card | Time lapse | Time zone | The beforetime | The meantime | The aftertime | The All-time`



## 死亡（Death）

每个人面对死亡的时候可能会不知所措，尤其是对于一些意外事件（废话，当然了）。



## 环境（Atmosphere）

> I‘m impressed with people who can create new spaces with the right words. I only know one language, and sometimes in a middle of a sentence I feel like a foreigner trying to talk it because I have word **spasms** where the parts of some words begin to sound peculiar to me and in the middle of saying the  word I'll think, "Oh, this can't be right--this sounds very peculiar, I don't know if I should try to finish up this word or try to make it into something else, because if it comes out good it'll be right, but if it comes out bad it'll sound **retarded**, and so in the middle of words that are over one syllable, I sometimes get confused and try to **graft** other words on top of them. Sometimes this makes good jounalism and when they quote me it looks good in print, and other times it's very embarrassing. You can never predict what will come out when the words you're saying start to sound strange to you and you start to patch."

说话的时候临场发挥有可能大放异彩，也有可能尴尬收场。



> The best atmosphere I can think of is film, because it's three-dimensional phiscally and two-dimensional emotionally.

最好的环境是电影，因为电影实际上是三次方的立体空间，但情感上是二次方的平面空间。



## 刺（The Tingle）

> My mind is like a tape recorder with one button -- Erase
>
> 我的心智像一部只有单键的录音机--消除键

> Maybe the reason my memory is so bad is that I always do at least two things at once. It's easier to forget something you only half-did or quater-did.
>
> 也许我的记忆力坏成这样，是因为我老是一心最少二用。如果你只花一半或者四分之一的力气做事，自然比较容易忘东忘西。



当安迪每天与他的B们打电话的时候，最常说的一句是：

> What's new? 有啥新鲜事？



## 后记（Afterword）

其实这本书给我的感觉就像是去了解一个特别的人，因为之前对安迪·沃霍尔也不太了解。所以，了解一个人的最好方式就是找到一个他最能表现出自我的媒介，比如他写的书、说的某些话、做的事情等。

读了中文版，也和原文对照着看了下，发现安迪是一个很聪明很世故对出名充满了强烈的渴望的人，他作为波普艺术的创立者，确实是有才华的。不过他也是普通人，也会在生活中遇到和普通人一样的问题，只不过他看待问题的方式确实有些特别。看到了最后几章，尤其是The Tingle，里面是他和朋友B打电话，B在收拾东西，然后接下来开始了朋友对自己正在收拾区域的描述：抽屉、桌子、壁橱、吸尘器扫地等等。真的就是通篇不分段然后一种碎碎念的感觉，很难看下去，So，That's all.
